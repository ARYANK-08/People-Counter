# Virtual Steering Using OpenCV
➡In this project, we have implemented a racing game where the virtual steering wheel is used to control the car's steering.

➡Once the object is detected, the user can use it to control the car's steering by rotating the object left or right.
➡The rotation of the object is tracked in real-time, and the car's steering angle is adjusted accordingly.



➡Used to play racing games using virtual Steering .


➡This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV to create a virtual steering wheel that can be used to control a game.
➡The project uses a webcam to capture video input, and then uses OpenCV's computer vision capabilities to detect the 
position and orientation of a real steering wheel or other object.
